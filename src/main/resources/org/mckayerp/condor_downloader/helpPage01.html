    Condor Downloader is a simple utility aimed at Condor Soaring pilots who want to fly tasks found on Condor.Club
    with ghost flight tracks. It makes it simple to download a flight plan and a number of flights from Condor.Club
    for a particular task, automating the download process so the user does not have to manage the repetitive handling
    of the files.
